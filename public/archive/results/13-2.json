You are considering different portfolios. Your choices are:\n- Invest in moderate risk Co. A. Over a year's time, the stock has a .5 chance of increasing 30% in value, a .2 chance of being unchanged, and a .3 chance of declining 20% in value.\n- Invest in high-risk Co. B. Over a year's time, the stock has a .4 chance of doubling in value, a .3 chance of being unchanged, and a .3 chance of declining 40% in value.\n- Invest in treasury bills. Over a year's time, they will yield a nearly certain return of 9%.\n- Invest in municipal bonds. Over a year's time, these will yield a tax-free rate of return of 6%.\n\nReturn a value from 1 to 4 representing your choice.",

Although Co. A offers a potential return of 30%, the possibility of a 20% decline means it's still relatively volatile. Treasury bills may offer a higher return, but the difference is not significant enough to offset the tax benefits of the municipal bond. Overall, investing in municipal bonds is a safe and practical choice for someone who wants to preserve their wealth while generating a moderate return.",
