By Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(H1|E) = P(E|H1) * P(H1) / P(E)\nP(H2|E) = P(E|H2) * P(H2) / P(E)\n\nwhere:\n\n- P(E|H1) is the probability that a Glom creature answers \"No, I don’t!\" to the question \"Do you play the harmonica?\", which is 1 - 0.58 = 0.42.\n- P(E|H2) is the probability that a Fizo creature answers \"No, I don’t!\" to the same question, which we don't know since the question is only about Gloms and not F",
