Similarly, 80% of Fizos climb walls, so the chances of encountering a non-wall climbing Fizo are (100-80)% or 20%. \n\nTherefore, out of all the non-harmonica playing creatures we could encounter, there is a higher chance (66.67%) that the creature is a Glom (with a 60% chance of encountering a non-harmonica playing Glom and a 40% chance of encountering a non-wall climbing Fizo) than a Fizo (with a 20% chance of encountering a non-wall climbing Fizo and an 80% chance of encountering a non-harmonica playing Glom).",
