However, if we assume that the man used three identical, fair and standard dice, the most probable number of rolls he made before entering the room would be around 30 times. \n\nPlease note that the actual number of rolls could be much lower, or much higher, depending on several factors such as the type, quality and randomness of the dice, the method used to roll them, the experience and skill of the person rolling the dice, and other variables. Therefore, this estimate is only a rough approximation, and it should not be taken as a precise or accurate calculation.",
