Similarly, 80% of 2 million creatures are Fizos which means there are 1,600,000 Fizos. \n\nNow, out of 1 million Gloms, 40% play the harmonica which means there are 400,000 harmonica-playing Gloms while 600,000 Gloms do not play the harmonica. \n\nSimilarly, out of 1 million Fizos, 80% climb walls which means there are 800,000 wall-climbing Fizos while 200,000 Fizos do not climb walls. \n\nNow, the creature in question said that it does not play the harmonica. Therefore, the creature cannot be one of the 400,000 harmonica-playing Gloms but it can be one of the 600,000 Gloms who do not play the harmonica or one of the 1,000,000 Fizos. \n\nThe probability that the creature",
