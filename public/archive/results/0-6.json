Let's call H the event that the creature is a Fizo, and not(H) the event that the creature is a Glom. Let's also call E the event that the creature does not play the harmonica, and not(E) the event that the creature does play the harmonica. \n\nWe want to calculate P(H|not(E)), the probability that the creature is a Fizo given that it does not play the harmonica. According to Bayes' theorem, this is equal to: \n\nP(H|not(E)) = (P(not(E)|H) * P(H)) / P(not(E))\n\nP(H) is the prior probability of the creature being a Fizo, which is 0.5 (since there are 1 million Fizos and 1 million Gloms). \n\nP(not(E)|H) is the probability that the creature does not play the harmonica given that it is a Fizo, which is 80% (since 20% of Fizos play",

Similarly, the number of Fizos who don't play the harmonica is 0.4 million (40% of 1 million, assuming that the remaining 20% also includes creatures who cannot play the harmonica for some reason). \n\nTherefore, the probability of a random creature not playing the harmonica is:\n\n(0.8 million + 0.4 million) / 2 million = 0.6\n\nOut of these non-playing creatures, the probability of a randomly chosen creature being a Fizo is:\n\n0.4 million / (0.8 million + 0.4 million) = 0.5714 or 57.14%\n\nSo, the probability of the creature being a Fizo given that it doesn't play the harmonica is:\n\n0.5714 / 0.6 = 0.9524 or ~ 71.4",
