Let's define some events:\n\n- G: the creature is a Glom\n- F: the creature is a Fizo\n- H: the creature plays the harmonica\n\nWe want to calculate the conditional probabilities P(F|not H) and P(G|not H), which represent the chances that the creature is a Fizo or a Glom, respectively, given that it doesn't play the harmonica. We can use Bayes' theorem to express these probabilities in terms of the prior probabilities P(F) and P(G), and the likelihoods P(not H|F) and P(not H|G):\n\nP(F|not H) = P(not H|F) P(F) / P(not H)\nP(G|not H) = P(not H|G) P(G) / P(not H)\n\nThe denominator P(not H) is the probability of not playing the harmonica, which can be calculated as:\n\nP(not H) = P(not H|F) P(F) + P(not H|G) P(G)\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nP(F) = 0",
