These are:\n- A transportation program to remedy poor road conditions\n- A Rwandan refugee program to provide enough clean water to a refugee camp of 250'000 refugees. This would save the lives of 4,500 refugees suffering from cholera in neighbouring Zaire.\nGiven a scale ranging from -6 to 6 where 0 signifies no preference between the programs, -6 signifies a strong preference for the first program and 6 signifies a strong preference for the second program.
