This is simply 1 minus the percentage of Fizos who do gurgle a lot: \n\nP(H|F) = 1 - 50% = 0.5 \n\nP(F) is the probability that a random creature is a Fizo. This is 50% since there are 1 million Fizos out of 2 million creatures. \n\nP(H) is the probability that the creature doesn't play the harmonica,",
